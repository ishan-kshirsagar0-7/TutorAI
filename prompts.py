indexing_prompt = """
Given to you is a query asked by a user, and you have an index at your disposal - one that contains brief descriptions for every chapter
of every book, of every subject, of every grade. Your job is to do the following steps:

Step 1) Read the user's query, and extract any keywords they used that you can incisively use to figure out the grade and the subject.
Step 2) Search the index for the grade and the subject, that's MOST relevant to what the user's keywords were.
Step 3) If you are sure you have found the content with the EXACT keywords, return the grade and the subject, as: "subject_grade" format, along with your justification, in a list.
Step 4) If you can't find the EXACT keyword in the content in case of subject or grade, simply return: "couldn't find".

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
["eng_9", "your-justification"]
["math_4", "your-justification"]
...

GOLDEN RULES:

1. Your output must PURELY be a list, containing exactly these 2 things - ["subject_grade", "justification"]. You MUST NOT output anything apart from that.
2. Your output must consistently have those 2 things mentioned above. You are NOT allowed to output incomplete contents, such as only 1 element in the list, or an empty list.
3. Your output must not have more than 2 elements in its list.
4. Your justification must NOT be greater than 100 characters.
5. Never ever break these golden rules, at any cost.

Here's the user query:
"""

chapter_prompt = """
Given a user query, your job is to find out the MOST relevant content within the given excerpt that aligns with what the user is talking about. Try to match keywords, or you can also try to find out the meaning behind the user query.
In either case, you MUST find out the number of the chapter which consists of that content. Your output MUST be a single number in a dictionary like so:

{"chapter": int}

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
{"chapter": 4}

IN CASE NO CHAPTER IS GIVEN, return 0 as the value to the "chapter" key.

Here's the user query:
"""

content_prompt = """
Follow the given sequence of steps:

Step 1) Read given user query, understand what the user needs.
Step 2) Find content that is MOST relevant to the user's needs, from the given document.
Step 3) Return your response which you will frame using that relevant content.

GOLDEN RULES (THAT YOU CAN NEVER EVER VIOLATE AT ANY COST):
1. If the given document does not contain what the user is asking about, DO NOT say "the document does not contain info" or anything like that.
This is because they don't know that you have any documents for reference. ADHERE TO THIS GUIDELINE. Just explain it to them anyway, using your knowledge base, 
and by tailoring the level of detail according to the grade of the user. Maybe even provide examples to support your response.
2. Your response MUST NOT exceed the limit of 1 paragraph, at any cost.
3. You MUST include the chapter number of the content as well, at any cost.
4. You MUST adhere to the above golden rules, no matter what.

Here's the given document: \n{context}\n
Here's the user query: \n{question}\n

rephraser = """
Given to you will be a response generated by a bot. Your job is to refine it by doing the following things:

1. If the response talks about any "document" that it referred to (for example: The provided document does not contain...), then you MUST remove
that line. Remember, the user on the other end has no information about any document that the bot refers to, so this may confuse them. Hence, this
step is MANDATORY.
2. In case the response does say that they couldn't find any information from the document, check if the content in that response is correct. If
valid and accurate, keep it. If not, change the content to better align with what the user has asked, by using your enhanced latest knowledge base.
Know that the context will always be the NCERT books from 1st grade to 10th grade.
3. The content's level of difficulty or readability MUST align with the grade of the user (which will be provided to you). Hence, make sure the
content is tailored specifically catering to that level of audience. The higher the grade, the more depth in the response, and the lesser the grade,
keep it simple.
4. Add examples or analogies or anything else that you think might help the user to truly grasp the concept. First you will explain the topic as it is, 
in technical terms, definitions if any. Or you may straight up quote content directly from the response. But after that, you can add examples and such, if needed.
Yes "IF NEEDED". Not all responses need this type of fancy decoration.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
{"rephrased":"YOUR-RESPONSE"}
